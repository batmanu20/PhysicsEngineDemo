# PhysicsEngineDemo

After learning enough rendering knowledge, I always want to try to bulid a 3D physics engine by myself.  
This repo is a practice following these two blogs:  
1.https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics  
2.https://allenchou.net/game-physics-series/  
  
It works in Unity, however far away from 100% finished.   
A lot of temp or debuging code exists, and a lot of detail patch is not added.  
For example, method of resolving dithering or far collision detection.  
Anyway it is enough for me to learn how physics engine works, most difficult and best part is completed.  
Maybe in future, i will reconstruct a c++ version, and add it to my own rendering engine or finally to my game.  

Here is how it works
